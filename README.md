# Course-Management-System

This is a Java based implementation of Course Management System supporting Admin , Teacher and Student roles.
I have tried to use some OOP Design principles. The GUI used is JavaFx and Database used is MySQL.

* Admin Roles 

   * Can add records (teacher, courses, registration, students, sections etc.)
   * Have some special permissions like opening/closing registration, adding users for sign-up

* Student Roles 
   * Can register for courses
   * Can check registrations, attendance, results
   * Some extra features related to profile (i.e. change password)

* Teacher Roles
   * Can add evaluations
   * Can take attendance
   * Can see their sections and courses


## Here are some screenshots of UI
