# Course-Management-System

Hello there !

This is a Java based implementation of Course Management System supporting Admin , Teacher and Student roles.
I have tried to use some OOP principles. The GUI used is JavaFx and Database used is MySQL.

Some files are missing because of broken links (while moving from Swing to JavaFx). They'll be added in sometime.


* Admin Roles 

   * Can add records (teacher, courses, registration, students, sections etc.)
   * Have some special permissions like opening/closing registration, adding users for sign-up

* Student Roles 
   * Can register for courses
   * Can check registrations, attendance, results
   * Some extra features related to profile (i.e. change password)

* Teacher Roles
   * Can add evaluations
   * Can take attendance
   * Can see their sections and courses


## Here are some screenshots of UI
